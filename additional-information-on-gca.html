            <ul class="list-disc pl-5">
                <li class="mb-2">The <strong>GCA or General Coding Assessment</strong> is a <strong>standardized test</strong> that measures core programming and computer science knowledge.</li>
                <li class="mb-2">The <strong>Coding Score</strong> obtained from the test is a measure that is intended to give recruiters, hiring managers, and test-takers an overall view of:</li>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-5">
                    <li class="mb-2">test-taker's code-writing and problem-solving skills</li>
                    <li class="mb-2">the ability to produce clean code and</li>
                    <li class="mb-2">the ability to write code at a reasonable speed</li>
                </ul>
                <li class="mb-2">Test takers can <strong>choose any programming language</strong> of their choice to complete the tasks.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-secondary">When Should I take it?</h2>
            <p>Test-taking can be nerve-racking; we get it! But we at BloomTech are here to help and support you along the way. That is why we <strong>recommend that you take the GCA as often as permitted</strong>.</p>
            <p>Taking the GCA many times will help you improve your score and prepare you for the test-taking environment and make you feel more comfortable with the process.</p>
            <p>There are <strong>other benefits to taking the GCA as often as possible</strong>: it helps you prepare for job interviews and gives you a flavor for the types of questions you'll be asked. For this reason, we've blocked time during the learning journey allowing you to take the assessment at least one time in each unit. It would help if you also planned on taking it every four weeks after you graduate while you look for a job.</p>
            <p><em>Remember:</em> You can only take the actual GCA test every two weeks after a cool-off period. The cool-off period begins when you submit the GCA test. If you submit at 5 pm, you can only retake the assessment in 2 weeks at 5 pm or later.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-secondary">Why Does the GCA matter to me?</h2>
            <p>If you are interested in working at a <strong>FAANG company</strong>, you absolutely need to pass the GCA. But even if you are <strong>not interested</strong> in a FAANG company, you will likely need to pass something similar at most companies - large, small, or startups. So taking the GCA helps <strong>prepare you for interviews</strong> that include a whiteboard/algorithm test as part of the interview process.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-secondary">How to Prepare and What Does the Coding Score mean?</h2>
            <p>While the GCA assessment has four tasks, we encourage you to <strong>prepare for Task 1 and Task 2</strong>. If you solve Task 1, your Coding Score will be from 650-674. If you solve Task 2, you will receive a Coding Score of 688 - 712.</p>
            <p>A <strong>minimum score of 650 is required</strong>, which you will receive by solving Task 1.</p>
            <p>Here is a breakdown of what you need to know to solve Task 1 and Task 2. Remember, you can choose any programming language to complete these tasks.</p>
