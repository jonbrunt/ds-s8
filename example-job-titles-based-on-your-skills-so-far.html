<p><span>Every time you hit this core competency in the Career Readiness Module the list of job titles you can apply for will grow, as your skills grow! We wanted you to see that you’re already learning skills relevant to the tech industry and have ways to start using those now. </span><span>That being said, you do not have to apply for any roles at this point in the program. However, we still encourage you to go through the content and take a stab at finding roles on your own. This will help you feel a bit more confident when you do decide to jump into the job search.</span></p>
<p><span>The list below is not exhaustive but does give you an idea of the types of titles you will want to explore as you search for roles. Keep in mind these can be full-time or part-time positions.&nbsp; Part-time/contract roles can help you continue to build your technical skills while also providing some additional income as you finish the program. And you never know, they could lead to a full-time opportunity closer to graduation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Lean into the skills you’ve learned from a previous profession as well - they can be extremely helpful in separating yourself from others in the job market. For example, if you worked any kind of customer service role before coming to BloomTech highlighting those skills on your resume for a Customer Support role or Client Success Specialist will help shape you as a more well-rounded candidate. Your background and experience pre-BloomTech will impact the roles you are eligible to apply for. Keep that in mind as you start to read through job descriptions and consider applying.</span></p>
