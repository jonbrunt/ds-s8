<h3><strong>What is a Get it Done Session?</strong></h3>
<p><span>Get it Done sessions are live experiences taught by our expert instructors designed to help you prepare the required career artifacts.</span></p>
<p><span>Get it Done are live classes, 50 minutes in length designed to offer additional support and an opportunity for live Q&amp;A. Get it Done sessions are offered seven days a week in the morning, afternoon, and evening.</span></p>
<p><span>Because Get it Done sessions are structured to focus on different aspects of career artifacts, you should come to the live session prepared. This means reading or watching the core competency content, and at least having reviewed the practice activity.</span></p>
<p><span>Get it Done sessions will help you complete the practice activity and the sprint challenge requirement.</span></p>
