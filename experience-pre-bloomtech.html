<h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
</div>
<div class="content-box pad-box-mini border border-rbl">
<p>The experience section of your resume serves as a comprehensive overview of your professional background and achievements, providing employers with insight into your skills, capabilities, and suitability for the job. As a career transitioner it’s extremely important to highlight the transferable skills you gained in previous roles prior to BloomTech. Your experience does not have to be related to the tech industry in any way.</p>
<p>There are transferable skills you can highlight from any work experience from Server to Product Manager!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Step 1: Select your most relevant/recent experience</strong></h4>
<p>Whether you have limited experience pre-BloomTech, extensive experience, or are maybe coming off a career break we promise you have experience that is relevant to showcase! Start by writing down the different roles you’ve held and making notes under each about what you did. You specifically want to think about accomplishments or things you can quantify. Don’t just list your job responsibilities instead think about what YOU did that was different from everyone else in your same role.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say you spent a few years as a server or retail store associate. Did you ever increase sales via upselling? My guess is yes you did! So write that down. These descriptions don’t have to sound fancy or be in the perfect format, this is about getting everything down on paper so you have it all in front of you.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tip</strong>: If you have extensive experience from your career pre-BloomTech, create a master resume with all of your experience on it (this can be as long as you need it to be). You can then pick and pull from this resume the experience that is most relevant to the role you are applying for.</p>
<p>For the purposes of your career artifacts submission you should include your most recent experience. Ideally you are targeting a 1 page resume because no matter how much previous experience you have you are still new to the tech industry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Step 2: Format your experience</strong></h4>
<p>Below is an example of the appropriate format for your previous experience. You will need to include:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li>Company name</li>
<li>Location</li>
<li>Your title</li>
<li>3 - 4 bullet points to highlight key accomplishments and contributions</li>
<li>Dates of employment (month year - month year OR year - year)<strong><br></strong></li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Step 3: Write bullet points</strong></h4>
<p><span>In the Experience section, we want to quantify (even if estimated) the value you brought your teammates and the companies you were at. This section should clearly highlight your actions, the results of your actions, and the overall value Impact you generated for the company.</span></p>
<p><span>You may notice the format of your experience bullet points looks very similar to your project bullet points and that’s okay, they should! </span><span>Well-written bullet points with action verbs and quantifiable achievements capture the reader's attention and make the resume more engaging and memorable.</span></p>
<p><span>Just as you did with your Project’s section be sure to keep these tips in mind as you start to write your bullet points:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Start with Action Verbs:</strong><span> Begin each bullet point with an action verb to demonstrate your proactive approach and make your accomplishments stand out. Examples include "developed," "implemented," "managed," "led," "optimized," etc. </span><span>Check out this </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1To5Fb4kKKz8Vonmx5j7xA75Hm02zMZmu/view"><span>list</span></a><span> for other ideas and examples.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Quantify Achievements:</strong><span> Whenever possible, quantify your accomplishments with numbers, percentages, or other measurable metrics. This provides evidence of your contributions and makes your achievements more impactful. For example, "increased sales by 25%," "reduced processing time by 50%," etc.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Provide Context:</strong><span> Give context to your achievements by including relevant details such as project scope, team size, or budget constraints. This helps recruiters understand the scale and complexity of your responsibilities.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Focus on Results:</strong><span> Highlight the results and outcomes of your actions rather than just listing your job duties. Emphasize how your contributions positively impacted the organization or project.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Write in 3rd Person:</strong><span> You should not be using</span><span> “I” “my” “me” anywhere on your resume or within your bullet points. For instance, rather than stating "I managed the company's social media accounts," you can simply say "Managed the company's social media accounts."</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Length of Bullet Points:</strong><span> Each bullet point should only be one sentence and should not include any sub bullet points.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Follow this formula</strong> when writing your bullets: <span style="color: #169179;">Accomplished [X]</span> as <span style="color: #236fa1;">measured by [Y]</span> by <span style="color: #e67e23;">doing [Z]</span>. In other words, start with an active verb, numerically measure what you accomplished, provide a baseline for comparison, and detail what you did to achieve your goal.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span><strong>Add details</strong> to highlight your direct work actions and tools you used or processes you contributed to that helped improve workflow and data accuracy, and reduced the risk of errors to increase productivity by X%or$</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Examples</strong></h4>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Need help getting started?</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></h4>
<p><span>Use ChatGPT to get an idea of what types of things you could include within your bullet points.</span></p>
<p><span>Try out prompts about your role: </span><em><span>“Write 5 resume bullet points for a Server at Texas Roadhouse”</span></em></p>
<p><span>Next, get more specific with some of your accomplishments (use those notes you took about your roles!):</span></p>
<p><span>Prompt: <em>“Update the resume bullet points to include the following accomplishments: won award for most number of upsells in a shift, consistently received 5 star survey results, selected as employee of the month twice.”</em></span></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong><span> Don’t just copy and paste the result as these are general bullet points for the roles and may include items outside of the scope of what you did. This is to give you a place to start and ideas for what you could include.</span></p>
