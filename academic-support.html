It's important to note, however, that to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to benefit from this valuable resource, we limit learners to <strong>one (1) session per week</strong>. This allows us to serve as many learners as possible and ensures that our Learner Assistants have the time to devote to each session.</p>
                    <p>While Learner Assistants are available to aid you in overcoming obstacles, they should not serve as a replacement for the instructor or live events. If you're unable to find a live event that suits your availability, please reach out by submitting a support ticket. We'll make every effort to accommodate your needs.</p>
