<h3><strong>What is CodeSignal?</strong></h3>
<p><span>CodeSignal is an online skills-based assessment platform that is used for technical hiring. It is a platform that allows you to practice and get your coding skills certified.</span></p>
<p><span>In order to participate in the certified assessments and practice challenges, you must be set up in this environment and get familiar with the interface.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Instructions</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>Set up your account in CodeSignal.* Use this link: <a class="inline_disabled" style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;" href="https://app.codesignal.com/signup" target="_blank">Create Your Account in CodeSignal</a></li>
<li>Sign up with your personal email address.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>*NOTE:&nbsp; When you create your CodeSignal account, you must use the same email address that you use to log in to the Portal - this is CRITICAL, otherwise your results will not sync to the BloomTech database.</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What happens if the email I use to log in to CodeSignal to take the General Code Assessment (GCA) test differs from the email I use to log in to the Portal?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If the email logins don't match, your GCA test results will not be tracked in the BloomTech database, and you will have to retake the GCA using your matched login credentials.</li>
</ul>
