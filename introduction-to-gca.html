        <p>Are you ready to take your coding skills to the next level? The General Coding Assessment (GCA) on CodeSignal is your gateway to showcasing your programming prowess. This comprehensive test evaluates your problem-solving abilities, coding efficiency, and technical knowledge, giving you a clear benchmark of your skills.</p>

                <ul class="list-disc pl-5">
                    <li>The <strong>GCA or General Coding Assessment</strong> is a <strong>standardized test</strong> that measures core programming and computer science knowledge.</li>
                    <li>The <strong>Coding Score</strong> obtained from the test is a measure that is intended to give recruiters, hiring managers, and test-takers an overall view of:</li>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-5">
                        <li>test-taker's code-writing and problem-solving skills</li>
                        <li>the ability to produce clean code and</li>
                        <li>the ability to write code at a reasonable speed</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Test takers can <strong>choose any programming language</strong> of their choice to complete the tasks.</li>

            <summary class="text-lg font-semibold">When Should I Take GCA</summary>
            <div>
                <p>Test-taking can be nerve-racking; we get it! But we at BloomTech are here to help and support you along the way. That is why we <strong>recommend that you take the GCA as often as permitted</strong>.</p>
                <p>Taking the GCA many times will help you improve your score, prepare you for the test-taking environment, and make you feel more comfortable with the process.</p>
                <p>There are <strong>other benefits to taking the GCA as often as possible</strong>: it helps you prepare for job interviews and gives you a flavor for the types of questions you'll be asked. For this reason, we've blocked time during the learning journey allowing you to take the assessment at least once in each unit. It would help if you also took it every four weeks after graduation while looking for a job.</p>
                <p><em>Remember:</em> You can only take the actual GCA test every two weeks after a cool-off period. The cool-off period begins when you submit the GCA test. If you submit at 5 pm, you can only retake the assessment in 2 weeks at 5 pm or later.</p>

        <details class="mb-4">
            <summary class="text-lg font-semibold">Why Does the GCA Matter to Me</summary>
            <div>
                <p>If you want to work at a FAANG company, you must pass the GCA. But even if you are <strong>not interested</strong> in a FAANG company, you will likely need to pass something similar at most companies - large, small, or startups. So taking the GCA helps <strong>prepare you for interviews</strong> that include a whiteboard/algorithm test as part of the interview process.</p>

            <summary class="text-lg font-semibold">How to Prepare and What Does the Coding Score Mean</summary>
            <div>
                <p>While the GCA assessment has four tasks, we encourage you to <strong>prepare for Task 1 and Task 2</strong>. If you solve Task 1, your Coding Score will be 295. If you <em>also</em> attempt Task 2, your score will be 300 or higher.</p>
                <p>A <strong>minimum score of 295 is required</strong>, which you will receive by solving Task 1 correctly.</p>
                <p>Here is a breakdown of what you need to know to solve Task 1 and Task 2. Remember, you can choose any programming language to complete these tasks.</p>
