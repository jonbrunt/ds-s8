<h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
</div>
<div class="content-box pad-box-mini border border-rbl">
<p>During your job search, you'll find that many applications ask you to link to your GitHub profile. This is an opportunity to use GitHub as a tool to promote yourself and represent your skills. You want to make it as easy as possible for your prospective employer to imagine you as a contributing member of their team by showcasing your contributions to projects in an organized, compelling way.</p>
<p>To get started we are going to create a Github profile with you if you don’t already have one.&nbsp;Start by pulling up: <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">https://github.com/</a></p>
<p>Once you have the webpage pulled up login if you already have an account.</p>
<p>If you do not have an account, click on the "Sign up" button and follow the prompts to create a new account.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Choose a username that is professional and reflects your identity or expertise. Avoid using personal nicknames that may not convey professionalism. Your username will also serve as your Github handle and people latch onto these names. Pick something you don’t mind being referred to as you get started in your career.</p>
<p>Within your new profile, Github allows you to share information about yourself with other GitHub users by setting a profile picture and adding a bio to your profile. These are often a person's first impression of you so make sure they are professional and represent you effectively.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Upload a &nbsp;Professional Photo</strong></h4>
<p>When you sign up for an account, GitHub provides you with a randomly generated "identicon". Your identicon is generated from a hash of your user ID, so there's no way to control its color or pattern. You can replace your identicon with an image that represents you by following the steps outlined below:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li>Once logged in, click on your profile icon in the top right corner.</li>
<li>Select "Settings" from the dropdown menu.</li>
<li>Under “Profile Picture”, select “Edit” and then “Upload a Photo”.</li>
<li>Choose a professional photo from your computer and upload it.</li>
<li>Crop and adjust the photo as needed, then click "Set new profile picture".</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Create Your Bio</strong></h4>
<p>The Bio box is a place to include titles that you are interested in and make it clear to employers viewing your profile that you are in fact interested in the industry. This is very similar to your LinkedIn and resume heading. You’ll also be able to add links to other social media accounts.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li>Select “Edit Profile” on your public profile.</li>
<li>Under "Public profile", in the "Name" field, type the name you want to be displayed on your profile.</li>
<li>Under “Bio” add a similar tagline or headline that showcases target job titles. This reaffirms that you are in this line of work and makes it very clear the type of work you are looking for. You can also add your key tech stack or target tech stack.</li>
<li>Fill in any additional info you would like to include in the spaces provided</li>
</ol>
