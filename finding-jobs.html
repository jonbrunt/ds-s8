<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
</div>
<div class="content-box pad-box-mini border border-rtl">
<p>It’s that time again! You’ve completed another 4 sprints and have gained new skills and experience that make you qualified for roles within tech. We will continue to &nbsp;explore jobs in every career readiness module throughout your time at BloomTech. Remember, these might not be the flashy titles you originally had in mind, like Software Developer or Data Scientist but you’ll get there!</p>
<p>We will be exploring tech-adjacent roles that align with the tech skills you’ve learned but will also be using some of the soft or transferable skills you’ve gained from pre-BloomTech experiences. The best part - you can apply for these roles TODAY. It's not just about snagging some income – it's about gaining valuable experience that'll make you more marketable as you get closer to graduation.&nbsp;</p>
